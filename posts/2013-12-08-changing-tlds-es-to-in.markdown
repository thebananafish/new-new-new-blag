title: changing TLDs .es => .in
---
so bananafish.es is coming up for renewal next month and I don't think I will be keeping it.

*gasp!*

I originally purchased bananafish.es from namecheap.com, who had it for only $10 I think.  It was great at the time until I ran into some issues (don't recall exactly what), and had to open a support chat.  
Long story short the lady from namecheap had no idea what a .es even was nor knew that namecheap even sold them. 

Sooo..

I transferred the domain name to gandi.net, who is pretty awesome.  They give free webhosting, email, ssl certs, and more.  
Anyway to purchase this domain I somehow managed to prove my Spanish heritage to Namecheap and it went through.  I do not think it will work this time with gandi.\n\nI also own bananafish.in and think I will just move everything over to that, it actually already is working for most bananafish things.  Unless I can find a \"better\" domain name.  \nI considered bananafi.sh but at $100/yr, it is not worth it to me.\n\nAnyway once I decide to make it official I will put it in bold on the main bananafish site.
