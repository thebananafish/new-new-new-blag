title: mission accomplished

ok so life has been really, really busy lately.  and this week should be the last hell week for awhile.  With 4 classes going on right now and craziness at work, it just seems like I cannot catch a break.

Today was no different, it was actually worse.

I had to migrate our FOG server to its own box today.
I had to migrate our Moodle server to a VM today (because management).
I had to migrate/backup/restore/bork the mail.installgentoo server today.

and it all went, without a hitch

hopefully once these classes get under control, I can post more.
