title: totally swamped

I am absolutely swamped with coursework now, and will be for a few more weeks.

It would seem that I did not look too far ahead when I first registered for spring and summer courses.
So that now there is some overlap as summer courses phase in and spring courses aren't phasing out quick enough.

I have so many projects going on and no time for them sadly.
