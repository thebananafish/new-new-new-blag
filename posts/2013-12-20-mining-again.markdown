title: mining again!
---
Okay so with recent events happening in the realm of cryptocurrencies I have taken another look into mining.  I stopped back in May of this year as things looked like they were going [sour with bitcoin](http://betabeat.com/2013/05/department-of-homeland-security-shuts-down-dwolla-payments-to-and-from-mt-gox/), that can be read [here](http://blog.bananafish.es/the-end-of-bitcoins-for-me/).

I have chosen to get back into mining with Litecoins and dogecoins.  These coins value-wise seem to be the next most promising coin under bitcoins.  And currently are going for ~30USD/1LTC.

Anyway since I had stopped I had taken my dedicated mining rig and set it up as my local KVM virtualization server.  A few nights ago I threw in my two remaining 5850s (sold the rest) and went about trying to get back into this game.

In total it took about 6 hours trying to get drivers and mining to work in Debian7.  I was pretty adamant about sticking with Debian as I really wanted to keep my virtual machines as they are.  

What took the longest was the trial and error and rebooting of installing different versions of the AMD official driver, various SDK, and compiling and recompiling cgminer.

In the next blog post I will explain the nitty-gritty details of what I did to finally get mining again, as I cannot seem to find any other tutorials, blog posts, or other documentation out there that works all the way through.
